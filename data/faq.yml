If you'd like to explore other things, especially if you're considering staying in Portland for a few extra days, feel free to reach out for more info on local options. <br><br> It may require an Uber or two, but there's a Glatt Kosher takeout counter (with a full time mashgiach), a bakery, and a Cafe (Cholov Stam and Pareve), all in the Southwest. There's also a Jewish Community Center and Chabad chapter, both of which may be of assistance. They can also help track down a daily minyan if needed."

  a: "Indeed! There will be on-site childcare available from 8:30am to 6pm, with a midday break for lunch, which is <i>not</i> provided (not provided for the kiddosâ€”adult lunch is of course part of conference admission, and you're welcome to take your little ones through the buffet line with you if the foods are appropriate for them). <br><br> Limited spaces are available first-come first-served, while openings remain. You'll be asked about it when you register for your ticket and then we'll get in touch about details. For these purposes, 'first come' means 'registered for the conference first'."
