    bio: "Aaron Turon (aturon) is a member of the Rust Core Team and employed by Mozilla Research. His main focus in Rust is language design, libraries, and project management. Prior to joining Mozilla, Aaron received his PhD from Northeastern University, with a focus on language and library design around lock-free data structures and other low-level concurrency concerns. His work won the John C. Reynold's award for outstanding dissertation in programming languages. He also worked with Derek Dreyer on correctness proofs of lock-free data structures, developing an early technique for doing so on top of the C11 memory model."

  - title: "Integrating Rust into Tor: Successes and Challenges"
    abstract: |
      <p>In 2016, The Tor Project's network team decided to experiment with writing existing and new functionality in Rust. Since then, this experiment has turned into a team initiative, with multiple team members adding infrastructure and new functionality with the goal of integrating Rust components directly into the core Tor code base. By 2019, we will have several features tha will be only supported in Rust.
      <p>With this effort has come many challenges and questions, some which have remained unresolved. In this talk, we propose walking through this timeline, and sharing what we have learned, what was good, and what was challenging about integrating Rust into a 10+ year old security-critical C codebase. We will also offer ideas about what could make this easier going forward, and what we are excited and hoping to see in future Rust versions. Overall, we at The Tor Project are big fans of Rust. We are looking forward to sharing what we have learned and accomplished over the last two years.

  - title: "Space, The Rusty Frontier"
    abstract: |
      <p>Space. It is often thought of as the final frontier for humans. Why not also for Rust?
      <p>In the fall of 2017 we began using Rust on an upcoming CubeSat mission. Writing safe, performant software is a high priority for us, one shared by the aerospace industry. Our software framework was originally written in C but we wanted to explore other options which could give us more confidence in our code and allow us to leverage newer technologies. For us Rust fits the bill with its emphasis on safety, growing community, and high level software patterns.
      <p>This presentation will cover the finer points of why we settled on Rust, how we integrated Rust into our existing C environment, how Rust has affected our developer productivity, pictures of the (first?) spacecraft running Rust in low Earth orbit and thoughts on the future of Rust in Space.

trainings:
  - title: "Rust for Beginners"
    speakers: steve
    timeslot: morning
    slug: beginner
    room: 0
    focus: "Rust Fundamentals: Ownership and Borrowing"
    abstract: |
      <p>Learn everything you need to get started writing Rust programs. The tutorial puts a focus on Ownership and Borrowing, which are the key techniques that Rust uses to achieve both safety and low-level performance.

      <p>This class assumes no prior knowledge of Rust, though programming experience in some other language would be helpful.

      <p>Participants should bring their own laptops. Additional machine setup instructions will be sent ~1 week prior to the training.
  - title: "Traits and Threads"
    speakers: aaron
    timeslot: morning
    slug: intermediate
    room: 1
    abstract: |
      <p>Move your Rust knowledge up a level! This tutorial introduces the second key piece of Rust, its trait system.
      You’ll learn how the trait system is the foundation for generic programming in Rust, allowing you to write one piece
      of code that can be reused in many contexts. The session will also cover how to write threaded programs in Rust, and
      demonstrate how threaded programming in Rust builds on the trait system to guarantee data-race freedom.
      
      <p>This tutorial assumes basic understanding of ownership and borrowing; if you have been writing Rust for a while, you should do fine.
      
      <p>Participants should bring their own laptops. Additional machine setup instructions will be sent ~1 week prior to the training.
  - title: "How to think in Rust"
    speakers: nrc
    timeslot: afternoon
    room: 0
    slug: think
    abstract: |
      <p>Learning a new programming language is hard. Even after mastering the syntax and type system, learning the libraries and techniques can take years.
      If you've read or written Rust and want to improve, this talk will give you a turbo boost! This will be a very practical tutorial, aimed at taking your Rust programming to the next level.
      We'll teach some core Rust design principles by covering a few key topics in depth. This tutorial is aimed at those with some Rust experience, but if you're a total beginner,
      you'll still learn a lot about what Rust programming is like in practice.
      
      <p>The tutorial will start with programming 'in the small': we'll explore some key library types (Option, Result, and Iterator) and cover practical error handling.
      Putting these together we'll see how to structure your control flow to write clear, succinct programs. We'll then cover some larger-scale design issues - using ownership
      as a primary architectural principle, and abstraction using traits. 
      
      <p>You'll learn how to be more productive in Rust by writing clean and idiomatic code. You'll learn to work with the language rather than fighting against it.

      <p>Participants should bring their own laptops. Additional machine setup instructions will be sent ~1 week prior to the training.
  - title: "Futures and Async Programming"
    speakers: mgattozzi
    timeslot: afternoon
    room: 1
    slug: futures
    abstract: |
      <p>Get started with understanding Asynchronous code in Rust! Whether you've just started using Async or you've been using
      it from it's inception there is something for everyone here. It'll show how to use the new async/await syntax, pinning api,
      and how to effectively leverage Futures in your Rust code. This class assumes you already have an understanding of how Rust works for the most part.

      <p>Participants should bring their own laptops. Additional machine setup instructions will be sent ~1 week prior to the training.
  - title: "WebAssembly"
    speakers: steve, ashley

  - title: "Secure Web Services in Rocket"
    speakers: sergio
    timeslot: morning
    room: 2
    slug: rocket
    abstract: |
      <p>Take the safety and reliability of Rust that you're used to into the world of web services with <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>!
      You'll write a fully working, database-backed web application in Rocket to learn first-hand how Rocket
      leverages Rust's type system and code generation facilities to prevent correctness and web security bugs at compile-time.
      Discover why thousands of developers and companies are writing or rewriting their web services in Rocket.

      <p>This workshop is intended for developers with experience writing software in Rust.
      Working knowledge of HTTP and the web will be helpful but not required.

      <p>Participants will need their own laptop. Before attending the workshop, participants
      should ensure that they can compile and run the "Hello, world!" Rocket application. Full instructions are available in <a href="https://rocket.rs/guide/getting-started/">Rocket’s Getting Started guide</a>.
  - title: "RustBridge"

    slug: rustbridge
    abstract: |
      <p>This free* workshop is for people who are members of groups that are underrepresented in tech, in the style of <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a>.
      There will be a morning introduction to Rust concepts and an afternoon hands-on project. This class assumes no prior knowledge of Rust, but familiarity with any other programming language, the command line, and a text editor is recommended.
  
      <p>Participants should bring their own laptops. Additional machine setup instructions will be sent ~1 week prior to the training.<br><br>
      *Free: A $29 + fees registration will be charged for RustBridge, that will later be refunded for all attendees who show up.
