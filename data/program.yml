  title: "Integrating Some Rust in VLC Media Player"
  abstract: "Parsing is hard. It is the cause of hundreds of vulnerabilities, implementation mistakes and plain crashes in production, because formats are badly designed and C is error prone.<br>Rust came with promises of safe, low level data manipulation, with efficient memory usage. The Nom parser combinators library was designed to verify those expectations and build fast, zero copy parsers that can easily be integrated in C applications.<br>This talk will cover the architecture and design decisions of nom, and how usability affects parser development."
