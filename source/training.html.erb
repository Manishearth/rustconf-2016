  <h1>Our Trainings</h1>

  <p>
    We'll be offering <em>three</em> Rust training sessions, and a RustBridge session, targeting different skill levels: <strong>Beginner</strong>, <strong>Intermediate</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>. You <em>may</em> take the morning Intermediate session followed by the afternoon Advanced session, but it is <em>not</em> appropriate to pair the Beginner and Intermediate sessions.
